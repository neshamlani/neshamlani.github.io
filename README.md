A simple Portfolio website made in React.
In the last version I made the UI using material-ui but as I want 
to update the UI so now I am changing the whole UI
making each component custom using styled component.
After this commit I will remove each and every component
and will start the complete website from scratch again.

I am removing all the dynamic datas. Making the whole site Static
and hardcoding all the datas.
